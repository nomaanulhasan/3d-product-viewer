# 3D Product Viewer App

During my learning journey with Three.js, I had the opportunity to build a captivating 3D product viewer app. This application allows users to interact with and explore various products in a virtual 3D environment. By leveraging the power of Three.js, I was able to create stunning visual effects, realistic lighting, and smooth animations, resulting in an immersive experience for the users.

## Features

- Interactive 3D product visualization.
- Realistic lighting and shading effects.
- Smooth animations for seamless product exploration.
- Ability to rotate, zoom, and examine products from different angles.
- Intuitive user interface for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

The 3D Product Viewer app was built using the following technologies:

- Three.js: A JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of WebGL-based 3D graphics, allowing for rich and interactive visualizations in the browser.
- HTML and CSS: Used to structure and style the user interface components.
- JavaScript: Utilized to handle user interactions, animate the 3D objects, and manage the application logic.

## Usage

To experience the 3D Product Viewer app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```https://github.com/nomaanulhasan/3d-product-viewer.git```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports WebGL.

3. Interact with the app by using mouse or touch gestures to rotate and zoom the product.

4. Explore the product from different angles and appreciate the visual effects and animations.
